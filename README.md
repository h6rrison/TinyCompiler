# TinyCompiler
Uses a recursive parser and interpreter in order to generate proper SSA instructions for a given program's control flow. Formats the instructions into GraphViz in order to visualize the control flow of the program, given the SSA instructions produced. 

To Run:
Have a valid .tiny file in the same folder as this program. 
In terminal, run: compiler.py tiny_file_name.tiny 

Output:
graphViz image with the control flow of the given  .tiny file.
